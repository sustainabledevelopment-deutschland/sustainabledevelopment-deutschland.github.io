Depending on the indicator, different selection menus are shown on the left. The first selection menu contains all time series available for the indicator. In the sub-menus you can select various variable values depending on the data series - e.g. different age groups.\n\nThe development of the time series is visualised in a chart. Click on the second tab next to “Chart“ to view, in a table, the data underlying the chart and all other data available from the selection menus (Fig. 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 2: Example of the presentation of SDG indicators using indicator 11.7.1 (as of April 2020)\n\n\n\nBelow, there are green buttons that allow the data to be downloaded in CSV format and, in the case of the chart, also as a PNG file.\n\nMetadata and data sources\n\nAt the bottom of the indicator pages you can see the following three tabs: “National Metadata“, “Global Metadata“ and “Data Sources“.\n\nThe “National Metadata“ tab provides a list of the national time series which correspond most closely to the global metadata. The national metadata sheet includes a comparison with the global requirements and related methodological and country-specific information.\n\nEach SDG indicator is managed by one or more custodian agencies. The custodian agencies, in consultation with the IAEG-SDGs, a statistical working group of the United Nations, determine the exact definition of and methodology for the respective indicator and publish these as global metadata. These can be found in the “Global metadata“ tab (Fig. 3). In addition to the indicator‘s detailed target, the Tier classification of the indicator is listed here as well.\n\nThe “Data sources“ tab provides links to the organisation(s) that submitted the data for the time series and, where possible, also direct links to the relevant data sources.\n\nComparison of SDG and DNS indicators\n\nThere are numerous overlaps between the indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy (DNS).\n\nAbout half of the DNS- indicators are similar to or congruent with the SDG- indicators. Both sets of indicators are also structured according to the 17 goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda, as the DNS represents the German Sustainable Development Strategy is aimed at implementing the global agenda. at the national level. More information on the DNSGerman strategy can be found in the “Useful information“ section „Interesting Facts“ andunder DNS.\n\nHowever, there are also differences. The names of the DNS indicators and especially their numbering are not identical to those of the SDG indicators. If an SDG indicator is comparable to a DNS indicator, this is indicated by a button with a direct link to the respective indicator (Fig. 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 3: Position of the direct link to similar or congruent indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the German Sustainable Development Strategy (as of July 2020)\n\n\n","id":""},"/en/en/about_platform/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/about_platform/","title":"The online platform\n","content":"The online platform comprises two components, namely the indicator set of the\nGerman Sustainable Development Strategy\n(Deutsche Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie, DNS) and the German set of indicators for the global sustainable development goals\n(Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs\nof the United Nations 2030 Agenda.

Accordingly, the icons and the colours chosen for the 17 goals (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2) which are used here and on the SDG online platform correspond to those of the United Nations. The icons are protected by copyright.\n\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 1: 17 inverted SDG icons of the United Nations and the N in the circle of the German Sustainable Development Strategy used on the DNS online platform\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 2: 17 SDG icons of the United Nations used on the SDG online platform for Germany \n\n\n\n\nAim and background\n\nThe target values to be achieved within the framework of the German Sustainable Development Strategy, the indicators, their data basis and calculations as\nwell as the graphical representations have been agreed by the Federal Government. The Federal Statistical Office was part of the process in a\nconsultative role. The structure of the German Sustainable Development Strategy and the selection of indicators are based on the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda\nand its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accordingly, at least one indicator for each of the 17 goals has been included in the German Sustainable Development\nStrategy in a thematically corresponding way.\n\nSince 2006, the Federal Statistical Office has been responsible for measuring the national indicators in a professionally independent process using\nits own data from official statistics and for coordinating the integration of data from other agencies.\nFor this reason, in addition to the German Sustainable Development Strategy indicators now published on the online platform, the Federal Statistical Office publishes\nan indicator report\nfor the German Sustainable Development Strategy every two years (most recently in 2021).\n\nStructure of the reporting platform\n\nThe platform is organised in goals, indicator fields and postulates, and their respective indicators (Fig. 1). Every four years the Federal\nGovernment reviews the strategy and its indicators. The strategy is modified if required, and indicators are i.e. replaced or new ones added.\n\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 3: Example for the structure of the DNS based on goal 7 “Affordable and clean energy” (as of the indicator report 2018)\n\n\n\nEach indicator of the DNS is presented individually or together with a closely related indicator on an own page. A chart visualizes the development\nof the indicator as well as - if possible - the goal to be reached. The definitions and intentions as well as the development of the indicators are\nexplained. The information stem from the biennial published\nIndicator Report of the Federal Statistical Office.\n\nFor some indicators the data are displayed at Federal States level. However, the goal shown stays the goal for Germany. Most of the Federal States\nof Germany have own sustainability strategies and indicators. They are not displayed the DNS platform.\nHere\nyou can find a compilation of sustainability strategies of the Federal States of Germany (also called “Länder”).\n\nThe symbols and choice of colour of the 17 goals (Fig. 1 and 2) which are used here and on the SDG-part of this reporting platform are copyright\nprotected by the United Nations.\n\nIndicator evaluation\n\nWeather symbols illustrate in an easy-to-understand way – from sunshine to thunderstorm (Fig. 4) - the course of development of most indicators.\nAn explanation of the definition of the symbols is found here.\nWeather symbols of the last four years can be found behind the button “indicator status summary” on each respective indicator page.\nA rough estimation about how stable the development was is possible by using the weather symbols. However, the symbols cannot replace the\nexplanatory texts with their background information.\n\nOn the top of the DNS page there is a button “evaluation”. If you choose in the following drop-down menu “summary”, the\nwhole development of the weather symbols of all indicators over time is shown.\n\nComparison of DNS and SDG indicators\n\nThe United Nations SDG indicators and their numbering are not identical to the DNS indicators.\nIf an SDG indicator is comparable to a DNS indicator, this is indicated by a button with a direct link to the respective indicator (Fig. 4).\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 4: Button to related global indicator (highlighted) and an example for a weather symbol based on indicator 6.1.a “Phosphorous in flowing waters” (state of the indicator report 2018)\n\n\n\nA direct link to the homepage of the SDG online platform can be found at the top right of this page next to the search field.\n\n\nTechnical background\n\nTo present the data for each participating country in a formatted form, the open source project Open SDG offers a standardised template of an\nonline platform on GitHub.

The 2030 Agenda, developed by the Member States of the United Nations, is a roadmap for “Transforming our world for the better“, aimed at achieiving a sustainable transformation in social, economic and environmental terms by 2030. It comprises 17 global goals that are subdivided into 169 targets with over 240 indicators. The goals are called Sustainable Development Goals and are abbreviated as SDGs (Fig. 1).\n\nMonitoring goal achievement\n\nThe United Nations Statistical Commission was mandated to develop global indicators for the targets together with the national statistical offices. The Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) established for this purpose presented a set of indicators and has continuously refined it. The IAEG-SDGs is composed of statistical offices of some Member States of the United Nations, including the Federal Statistical Office representing Germany.\n\nNational reporting on sustainable development in Germany\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office is responsible for coordinating and publishing national SGD indicator data for Germany and for statistical reporting on Germany’s progress in this field.\n\nIn July 2019, the Federal Statistical Office launched this online platform on the indicators of the UN global Sustainable Development Goals. Here time series and associated metadata regarding global sustainable development are provided in a processed and interactive form for Germany. The SDGs section of the online platform enables the competent international organisations (custodian agencies) to directly download Germany’s SDG indicator data and use them, for example, for global reporting assignments.\n","id":""},"/en/en/facts_dns/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/facts_dns/","title":"German Sustainable Development Strategy (DNS)\n","content":"Since 2002 Germany has had a national Sustainable Development Strategy with its own goals, indicator reports and postulates.

In the process of revising the strategy, at least one indicator was included for each of the 17 goals in line with the 2030 Agenda themes. The target values, indicators, data bases and calculations were adopted by the Federal Government.\n\nOn behalf of the Federal Government, the Federal Statistical Office has published a report on progress towards achieving the goals of the German Sustainable Development Strategy every two years since 2006.

This symbol is neither a political appraisal nor a forecast. Instead, the symbols provide a first impression of developments but do not replace a study of the explanatory texts, further analyses and background information. The manner in which the symbols are assigned to the individual indicators depends on the formulation of the respective target.\n\nIndicators with absolute or relative target values\n\nIn most of the cases an indicator is supposed to reach a concrete absolute or relative target value by a target year (for example indicator 3.1.a). In the case of such a target formulation, first the average annual change over the last five years is calculated by means of the last six data points. This value is imputed for all years up to the target year. Building on this development, a hypothetical target value is calculated and compared to the predefined target value of the indicator. Based on the resulting difference between these two values, the indicators are assigned one of the following symbols:\n\n   If the trend continues, the target value will be met or the difference between the target value and the current value will be less than 5 %.\n\n  \tIf the trend continues, the indicator will presumably miss its target by at least 5 % and at most 20 % of the difference between the target value and the current value.\n\n   The indicator is moving in the right direction but if the trend continues, the target value will be missed by more than 20 % in the target year.\n\n   The indicator is not moving in the right direction so that the gap to the target value is widening.\n\nIn exceptional cases where there are not enough data for the above mentioned calculation to be carried out, the last four consecutive points of time for which data are available will, as a minimum, be used to calculate the average change. In the case of less than four suitable annual values, there will be no calculation.\n\nIndicators with target intervals\n\nIf the target is not an exact value but a specific interval (for example indicator 11.1.a), the weakest of the targets in the target interval will be used to determine the status. If several target values have been specified for one indicator that are to be reached in different years (for example indicator 7.2.a), the next target year will be used to determine the status.\n\nIndicators with a constant target for each year\n\nIf a target value or a threshold is not to be reached at some time in the future but to be maintained in every single year (for example indicator 6.2.a, b), two pieces of information are combined for evaluation: primarily, the value last achieved and, subordinately, the average change over the last five years.\n\n\n  If the target value or an even better value was reached in the last year and the average trend does not indicate that there may be a setback, a sun is shown.\n  If the target value or an even better value was reached in the last year but the average trend indicates that there may be a setback, a sun is shown which is, however, partially hidden by a cloud.\n  If the target value has not been reached but the average trend is not moving away from the target, only a cloud is shown.\n  If the target value has been missed and the indicator is not moving towards the target, which indicated by the average change of recent years, a thunderstorm is shown.\n\n\nThis procedure is used also when an indicator is supposed to reach a concrete target value by an exact target year and has reached the goal already. In such cases the standard procedure cannot provide reliable information on the direction in which the indicator is moving.\n\nIndicators with directional targets without specific target values\n\nIn cases where only the targeted direction of the indicator trend is given but no concrete target value (for example indicator 15.3.a), two pieces of information are combined for evaluation: primarily, the average change over the last five years and, subordinately, the last annual change.\n\n\n  If both the average value and the last annual change point in the right direction, the symbol shown is a sun.\n  If the average trend is moving in the right direction but the last year was characterised by a trend in the wrong direction or no change at all, the sun is partly hidden by a cloud.\n  If, on the contrary, the average value points in the wrong direction or indicates stagnation while the last year appears to mark a turn in the desired direction, a cloud is shown.\n  If neither the average value nor the last change point in the right direction, the symbol shown is a thunderstorm.\n\n\nIndicators with several target values\n\nIf several targets are defined for one indicator that are to be reached at the same time (for example  indicator 10.1), the development is evaluated individually for each target. The most negative evaluation determines the weather symbol to be assigned to the indicator.\n\nComparison of evaluations over time\n\nThe synoptic table provides information also about the evaluation of an indicator in previous years.
