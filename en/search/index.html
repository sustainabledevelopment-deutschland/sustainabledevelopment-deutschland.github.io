The national metadata sheet includes a comparison with the global requirements and related methodological and country-specific information.\n\nEach SDG indicator is managed by one or more custodian agencies. The custodian agencies, in consultation with the IAEG-SDGs, a statistical working group of the United Nations, determine the exact definition of and methodology for the respective indicator and publish these as global metadata. These can be found in the âGlobal metadataâ tab (Fig. 3). In addition to the indicatorâs detailed target, the Tier classification of the indicator is listed here as well.\n\nThe âData sourcesâ tab provides links to the organisation(s) that submitted the data for the time series and, where possible, also direct links to the relevant data sources.\n\nComparison of SDG and DNS indicators\n\nThere are numerous overlaps between the indicators of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy (DNS).\n\nAbout half of the DNS- indicators are similar to or congruent with the SDG- indicators.

The 2030 Agenda, developed by the Member States of the United Nations, is a roadmap for âTransforming our world for the betterâ, aimed at achieiving a sustainable transformation in social, economic and environmental terms by 2030. It comprises 17 global goals that are subdivided into 169 targets with over 240 indicators. The goals are called Sustainable Development Goals and are abbreviated as SDGs (Fig. 1).\n\nMonitoring goal achievement\n\nThe United Nations Statistical Commission was mandated to develop global indicators for the targets together with the national statistical offices. The Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) established for this purpose presented a set of indicators and has continuously refined it. The IAEG-SDGs is composed of statistical offices of some Member States of the United Nations, including the Federal Statistical Office representing Germany.\n\nNational reporting on sustainable development in Germany\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office is responsible for coordinating and publishing national SGD indicator data for Germany and for statistical reporting on Germanyâs progress in this field.\n\nIn July 2019, the Federal Statistical Office launched this online platform on the indicators of the UN global Sustainable Development Goals. Here time series and associated metadata regarding global sustainable development are provided in a processed and interactive form for Germany.

How often is the data updated?\nThe frequency with which new data is published and the time at which this happens varies for many indicators.\nAs soon as new data is available for an indicator or previously published data is corrected, this data is also\npublished on this online platform. The platform is usually updated once a month. You can see when the last update\ntook place on the start page next to the button for downloading the data.\n\n2. How can I suggest new or different data sources?\nFor feedback on the data sources we use or for suggestions for new data sources, please contact us here: {{site.email_contacts.questions}}\n\n3. What is the meaning of the weather symbols?\nAll indicators in the DNS have specific targets that are to be achieved either annually or at a certain point in the future. The weather symbols are intended to give an impression of how an indicator is performing in relation to the respective target. A detailed description of how this assessment is carried out and what the weather symbols mean in detail can be found here.\n\n4. Why is there not a weather symbol for every indicator?\nWhen assessing the indicators with regard to their target achievement, not only a momentary snapshot is considered, but also the development of previous years. However, there are not enough data points available for some indicators, meaning that no assessment can be made in these cases.  For some other indicators, the comparability of the data over time is limited (e.g. due to methodological changes in data collection), meaning that no reliable statement can be made on target achievement.\n\n5. The texts and weather symbols for some indicators do not refer to the most recent reporting year. Why is this the case?\nThe Federal Statistical Officeâs reporting on the indicators of the German Sustainable Development Strategy provides for the publication of a comprehensive indicator report every two years. Since 2020, the data on the indicators has also been published on this platform. While the data on the platform is continuously updated, the texts and weather symbols cannot be constantly revised, as they are created in close consultation between the Federal Statistical Office and the responsible ministries. They therefore correspond to the status of the latest indicator report and may therefore refer to an older status in comparison to the data.\n\n6. What is disaggregation?\nDisaggregation is used to divide an existing indicator into further subcategories for more detailed analysis. The best known are age or gender. However, separate disaggregations apply to many indicators.\n\n7. Can other countries copy this website?\nThe website can be used freely to create your own online platform. The terms and conditions for the use of GitHub apply. Further information can be found at Technical guidance.\n","id":""},"/en/en/faq/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n","content":"How do I suggest new or different data sources?\nIf you have feedback on the data sources we have used or have suggestions for new data sources then please contact us at: {{site.email_contacts.questions}}.\n\nWhat does the reporting status mean?\nThere are three differently colour-coded reporting statuses for each indicator:\n\n\n  Reported online (green) â As a minimum the headline national data are available for this indicator on this website, but the data might not be fully disaggregated yet. We are seeking to fill this data gap.\n  Exploring data sources (red) â We are still looking for a suitable data source for this indicator of this.\n  Not applicable (grey) â The calculation of this internationally relevant indicator for Germany alone makes little sense or the indicators can only be compiled in a global context.\n\n\nWhere there is additional information about the status of indicator data collection and reporting, this will be displayed at the top of the indicator page.\n\nWhat does disaggregation mean?\nDisaggregation is used to break an existing indicator down into subcategories for closer examination. The best known are age or sex. However, the disaggregations used differ from indicator to indicator and are referenced in the indicator name or defined by the international organisation responsible for the indicator.\n\nWhat are you doing to fill data gaps?\nIf no data are available for an indicator, we need to look for possible data sources and check them for quality. If the quality meets our requirements, the data will be included in the SDG online platform.\n\nFor some indicators data are available at the national level, but the underlying data sources do not allow disaggregation by all required categories.\n\nThis makes it necessary to look for new data sources, link existing sources or model data.

The Indicator Report entitled \"Statusindikatoren einer nachhaltigen Entwicklung in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg\"\n          (Status indicators of sustainable development in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg) has been published since 2014. The fourth (2022) edition of the\n          report\n          was for the first time prepared only in interactive online format. It was issued by the Sustainable Development Strategy Office of the\n          Ministry for the Environment, Climate Protection and the Energy Sector of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. 52 status indicators give on overview of\n          sustainable development by providing data, background information and evaluations. 6 indicators offers insights into the personal attitudes\n          and feelings of the people in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. To improve the comparability of indicators at federal and Land levels, this set of indicators\n          was harmonised as far as possible with the nationwide set employed in the German Sustainability Strategy and the indicators used by the\n          Working Party for Sustainable Development\n          of the statistical offices of the LÃ¤nder. The\n          Land Statistical Office\n          Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg was involved in compiling the Indicator Reports.

It is the result of intensive collaboration between all Land ministries and\n          the State Chancellery. In its Sustainable Development Strategy, the Land government specifies the goals it sets itself and describes the\n          measures it is taking to achieve them. In August 2021, the Land Office for Statistics of Bayern also published the first\n          Indicator Report\n          on sustainable development. In addition, the Bavarian Environment Agency published\n          environmental indicators\n          for Bayern.\n        \n      \n      Berlin\n      \n        Assessing sustainable development in Berlin is based on a set of indicators consisting of 40 \"core indicators\", each of which is assigned to\n          one of the 17 global Sustainable Development Goals. The\n          Core Indicator Report\n          on sustainable development in Berlin was last updated in 2021 by the Senate Department for the Environment, Mobility, Consumer and Climate\n          Protection in cooperation with the Statistical Office of Berlin-Brandenburg.

As a result of various\n          phases of dialogue, Brandenburg's\n          Sustainable Development Strategy\n          was adopted in April 2014 and updated in 2019. A first report including 49\n          sustainable development indicators\n          for Brandenburg was submitted in July 2017. Taking stock of potential sustainable development indicators, it is intended as a basis for discussing\n          ways of implementing and updating the Sustainable Development Stategy of Brandenburg. The report was prepared by the Statistical Office of\n          Berlin-Brandenburg on behalf of the Ministry for Rural Development, the Environment and Agriculture of the Land of Brandenburg.\n        \n      \n      Bremen\n      \n        Every two years since 2021, Bemen has prepared a report on how the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals is progressing.\n          The report and the goals that will be derived from it replace the strategy for sustainable development. The State Chancellery of Bremen is\n          responsible for the coordination. The objectives of the 2030 Agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are monitored decentrally in the individual\n          ministries of Bremen.

In addition to identifying the aspects of the government's\n          policy which are already in line with the goals of the 2030 Agenda, the document points out the topics which have to be worked on in the next few years.\n          Plans have been made to develop a two-yearly reporting system together with the Statistical Office of North of Germany. The responsibility lies with the\n          Ministry for the Environment, Climate, Energy and Agricultural Industry.\n        \n      \n      Hessen\n      \n        In 2008 the Land government of Hessen launched the\n          \"Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie Hessen\"\n          (Sustainable Development Strategy for Hessen). Its goals and indicators were developed in a participative process. The indicators were revised fundamentally\n          with a view to the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted in 2015 and new target values were defined for 2030 as part of a\n          refinement process in the years 2017 and 2018. The goals and indicators were assigned to the fields of \"economy\", \"ecology\" and \"social affairs\" in the biennial\n          Progress Report\n          published between 2010 and 2016; the Progress Reports issued in 2020 and 2022 with 13 target indicators and 42 reporting indicators are structured according\n          to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda.A\n          supplementary edition\n          of the progress report 2022 in 2023 focussed on the 17 new indicators.\n          An integrated presentation of the 17 new and 68 old indicators is planned for the 2024 progress report.\n        \n      \n      Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\n      \n        To date there has been no Sustainable Development Strategy for Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. As set out in the 2016-2021 coalition agreement, a strategy for the\n          sustainable development of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is to be developed in line with the National Sustainable Development Strategy.\n        \n      \n      Niedersachsen\n      \n        In May 2017 the Land government adopted Niedersachsen's new indicator-based\n          Sustainable Development Strategy.\n          In September 2020, the first Progress Report on the \"NiedersÃ¤chsische Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie\" (Sustainable Development Strategy of Niedersachsen)\n          commissioned by the Land government was prepared by the Land Statistical Office of Niedersachsen. It focuses on adjusting and updating the sustainable\n          development indicators and, in particular, on an even stronger and more systematic integration of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations\n          into Niedersachsen's indicator set. The structure of the Progress Report follows the Sustainable Development Strategy and the selection of indicators is\n          based on the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals in terms of content.\n        \n      \n      Nordrhein-Westfalen\n      \n        The Land government adopted the first\n          Sustainable Development Strategy\n          for Nordrhein-Westfalen in 2016, which was updated in 2020. On behalf of the Land government of Nordrhein-Westfalen, the statistics sector of IT.NRW\n          (Central statistical and IT service provider of Nordrhein-Westfalen) prepared the first\n          Sustainable Development Report\n          in 2016 and updated it in 2020. It comprises nearly 70 indicators. Current data regarding the sustainable development indicators are provided online on an\n          Internet portal.\n        \n      \n      Rheinland-Pfalz\n      \n        A Sustainable Development Strategy\n          for Rheinland-Pfalz has been in place since 2001. In the beginning, the strategy was revised every two years. A first indicator-based report was published in 2005.\n          Since 2009, the Sustainable Development Strategy has been revised every four years. However, the data or\n          Indicator Report\n          (latest report with 27 indicators 2023) is still published every other year. The Land Statistical Office of Rheinland-Pfalz has been\n          responsible for preparing the Indicator Report since 2011.\n        \n      \n      Saarland\n      \n        The Sustainable Development Strategy for the Saarland entitled \"Gemeinsam Verantwortung tragen fÃ¼r heute und morgen\" (Sharing responsibility for today and\n          tomorrow) was adopted in December 2016 after a two-year preparation phase based on a dialogue within society at eye level. With its six areas of action and\n          39 indicators, the Sustainable development Strategy focuses on central sustainabillity topics which are relevant for the Saarland from its perspective as a\n          federal state but also in the global context. The Saarland was one of the first LÃ¤nder to show in its strategy which of the global sustainability goals adopted\n          under the 2030 Agenda are particularly relevant for the Land and what aspects require more attention.\n          \n          From 2020 to 2022, the Sustainable Development Strategy was updated under the aegis of the\n          Ministry\n          for the Environment, Climate, Mobility, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. The updating process was open for participation and focused on the ideas and\n          project approaches for implementing the Sustainable Development Strategy. Under the motto \"Wir gestalten gemeinsam. Saarland nachhaltig\" (Jointly shaping a\n          sustainable Saarland), all interested an committed citizens and stakeholders in society were invited to network and get into dialogue and thus play an active\n          part in the updating process. In this context, a team of sustainability experts selected ten flagship projects for a more sustainable Saarland from 80 proposals\n          submitted and the process of successful implementation was started jointly. The continuous development of sustainability is both the basis and the mission of Saarland's\n          Sustainability Policy - to be pursued together with citizens.\n        \n      \n      Sachsen\n      \n        The\n          Sustainable Development Strategy\n          describes major topics, central goals and challenges regarding the sustainable development of Sachsen. When the Sustainable Development Strategy was prepared in\n          2018, Sachsen's areas of action were linked with the Sustainable Developments Goals of the 2030 Agenda. These areas of action are addressed in the Sustainable Development\n          Report and sets of indicators, among others, are used for measurement purposes. The 2022\n          Sustainable Development Report\n          for Sachsen has been available since the end of 2022. Such reports are prepared once per legislative term.\n        \n      \n      Sachsen-Anhalt\n      \n        Under the aegis of the Ministry for Science, energy, Climate Protection and the Environment and in cooperation with other ministries involved, a new version of\n          the Sustainable Development Strategy was prepared for Sachsen-Anhalt in 2022. The strategy is based on the 17 Sustainable development Goals of the united\n          Nations' 2030 Agenda and presents the current situation, the framework conditions in Sachsen-Anhalt, the goals to be implemented and the relevant measures\n          that have to be taken to achieve these goals by 2030. The strategy includes an updated Indicator Report, which describes Sachsen-Anhalt's sustainability\n          goals and adapts goals for past periods to the 2030 perspective.\n          \n          Education is the central element of the Sustainable Development Strategy. It is regarded as on of the key factors of sustainable living in Sachsen-Anhalt. By assigning an individual target to promote the development of creative competencies for shaping the future, participation and critical thinking, an important contribution is made to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda. The Sustainable Development Strategy and more information on sustainable development in Sachsen-Anhalt are available\n          here.\n        \n      \n      Schleswig-Holstein\n      \n        In December 2018, the Land government of Schleswig-Holstein identified a total of 75 indicators as a basis for taking stock of the sustainable development\n          in Schleswig-Holstein and for measuring its sustainable development until 2030: 44 target indicators, 27 reporting indicators and 4 reference indicators.\n          Schleswig-Holstein's first report on the UN Sustainable Development Goals was published on this basis in June 2020. A PDF of the report is provided\n          here.\n          The report will be updated every five years. A webpage offering key information can be accessed\n          here.\n        \n      \n      ThÃ¼ringen\n      \n        The Land government adopted a Sustainable Development Strategy including relevant indicators for ThÃ¼ringen in 2011. The first Indicator Report with 27\n          indicators was published in 2012.\n          \n          When the 2030 Agenda was adopted, ThÃ¼ringen's Sustainable Development Strategy had to be adjusted. The\n          strategy\n          with five areas of focus and reference to the Sustainable Development Goals was adopted in 2018. Each ministry prepared its own\n          Sustainable Development Plan\n          in 2018, too, which supports sustainable action in the respective policy area. In 2019, ThÃ¼ringen's\n          indicator set for sustainable Development\n          was revised fundamentally, and its third\n          Indicator Report\n          was published in 2020. The preparation of the projects is organised by a State Secretaries' working group and the relevant inter-ministerial working group.\n          ThÃ¼ringen's Advisory Council on Sustainability is also involved in the projects. The\n          webpage\n          which has been accessible since 2021, give a good overview of the sustainability activities in ThÃ¼ringen.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nvar coll = document.getElementsByClassName(\"collapsible\");\nvar i;\n\nfor (i = 0; i &lt; coll.length; i++) {\n  coll[i].addEventListener(âclickâ, function() {\n    this.classList.toggle(âactiveâ);\n    var content = this.nextElementSibling;\n    if (content.style.maxHeight){\n      content.style.maxHeight = null;\n    } else {\n      content.style.maxHeight = (content.scrollHeight + 10) + âpxâ;\n    }\n  });\n}\n&lt;/script&gt;\n","id":""},"/en/en/status/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/status/","title":"Indicator status\n","content":"Assessment for Germany from previous years\n\nAs means of providing at-a-glance information on the status of the sustainability indicators, every indicator is assigned, if calculable, one of four âweather symbolsâ in the report. This symbol is neither a political appraisal nor a forecast. Instead, the symbols provide a first impression of developments but do not replace a study of the explanatory texts, further analyses and background information. The manner in which the symbols are assigned to the individual indicators depends on the formulation of the respective target.\n\nIndicators with absolute or relative target values\n\nIn most of the cases an indicator is supposed to reach a concrete absolute or relative target value by a target year (for example indicator 3.1.a). In the case of such a target formulation, first the average annual change over the last five years is calculated by means of the last six data points. This value is imputed for all years up to the target year. Building on this development, a hypothetical target value is calculated and compared to the predefined target value of the indicator. Based on the resulting difference between these two values, the indicators are assigned one of the following symbols:\n\n Â  If the trend continues, the target value will be met or the difference between the target value and the current value will be less than 5 %.\n\n Â \tIf the trend continues, the indicator will presumably miss its target by at least 5 % and at most 20 % of the difference between the target value and the current value.\n\n Â  The indicator is moving in the right direction but if the trend continues, the target value will be missed by more than 20 % in the target year.\n\n Â  The indicator is not moving in the right direction so that the gap to the target value is widening.\n\nIn exceptional cases where there are not enough data for the above mentioned calculation to be carried out, the last four consecutive points of time for which data are available will, as a minimum, be used to calculate the average change. In the case of less than four suitable annual values, there will be no calculation.\n\nIndicators with target intervals\n\nIf the target is not an exact value but a specific interval (for example indicator 11.1.a), the weakest of the targets in the target interval will be used to determine the status. If several target values have been specified for one indicator that are to be reached in different years (for example indicator 7.2.a), the next target year will be used to determine the status.\n\nIndicators with a constant target for each year\n\nIf a target value or a threshold is not to be reached at some time in the future but to be maintained in every single year (for example indicator 6.2.a, b), two pieces of information are combined for evaluation: primarily, the value last achieved and, subordinately, the average change over the last five years.\n\n\n  If the target value or an even better value was reached in the last year and the average trend does not indicate that there may be a setback, a sun is shown.\n  If the target value or an even better value was reached in the last year but the average trend indicates that there may be a setback, a sun is shown which is, however, partially hidden by a cloud.\n  If the target value has not been reached but the average trend is not moving away from the target, only a cloud is shown.\n  If the target value has been missed and the indicator is not moving towards the target, which indicated by the average change of recent years, a thunderstorm is shown.\n\n\nThis procedure is used also when an indicator is supposed to reach a concrete target value by an exact target year and has reached the goal already. In such cases the standard procedure cannot provide reliable information on the direction in which the indicator is moving.\n\nIndicators with directional targets without specific target values\n\nIn cases where only the targeted direction of the indicator trend is given but no concrete target value (for example indicator 15.3.a), two pieces of information are combined for evaluation: primarily, the average change over the last five years and, subordinately, the last annual change.\n\n\n  If both the average value and the last annual change point in the right direction, the symbol shown is a sun.\n  If the average trend is moving in the right direction but the last year was characterised by a trend in the wrong direction or no change at all, the sun is partly hidden by a cloud.\n  If, on the contrary, the average value points in the wrong direction or indicates stagnation while the last year appears to mark a turn in the desired direction, a cloud is shown.\n  If neither the average value nor the last change point in the right direction, the symbol shown is a thunderstorm.\n\n\nIndicators with several target values\n\nIf several targets are defined for one indicator that are to be reached at the same time (for example  indicator 10.1), the development is evaluated individually for each target. The most negative evaluation determines the weather symbol to be assigned to the indicator.\n\nComparison of evaluations over time\n\nThe synoptic table provides information also about the evaluation of an indicator in previous years. It shows if the weather symbol assigned to an indicator was rather stable or volatile in the past years.\n","id":""},"/en/en/status_summary/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/status_summary/","title":"Status overview\n","content":"\n","id":""},"/en/en/about/dns/monitoring/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/en/en/about/dns/monitoring/","title":"German Sustainable Development Strategy - Monitoring by the Federal Statistical Office\n","content":"The Federal Government revised the Sustainable Development Strategy substantially in 2016 in the context of implementing the\n2030 Agenda goals at the national level.
